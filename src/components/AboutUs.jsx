          <strong>HOW IT ALL STARTED (Isaac's Version)</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          “As part of the preparation from the department for the coming
          conference, let Miss Christianah and Mr Isaac handle the email to be
          sent to all the first-timers and new members”. These were the very
          words of our HOD at the vigil where I first met my Christianah. I did
          not meet her until two months after I relocated to Ibadan. My first
          time meeting Christianah was in church, not in a church service but a
          departmental vigil. We were preparing for the apex meeting of our
          church. We were both assigned to be in charge of sending out invites
          for the meeting via e-mails. So I can say that it was service in God’s
          house that brought us together. God is the absolute best in crafting
          love stories, you know?!
        </p>

        <p>
          I forgot to tell you that I did not save her number nor did I reach
          out to her personally to follow up on the assignment (my bad). I
          merely went doing “my thing”. I can remember our first conversation on
          WhatsApp, it was strictly business and it continued like that for
          days.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fast forward to the month after our conference, this beautiful lady
          walked up to me one day after service. “Are you fine? You looked so
          disturbed and you are not in your usual high spirit!” These were
          Christianah’s words to me that day. I rarely open up to people on
          personal matters but she kept pestering and when I saw her
          genuineness, I opened up to her. I had a long list of assessments and
          exams those days and I was already overwhelmed by the workload as I
          had little or no time to prepare for them again. She offered to assist
          to help me get ready for the assessments and exams. I initially
          laughed at the idea in my mind but she amazed me with her innovative
          approach by crafting out milestones for me and monitoring my progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her new supervisory role (lol) got us talking a lot, especially during
          the day and early hours of the night (yeah, she monitors my studying
          at night). Little did she know that as she was monitoring my studying,
          I was carefully studying her too and assessing her values, her mindset
          about life, her disposition to certain beliefs and her conviction
          about life. Just like the lock and key theory of drugs and drug
          receptors, she fits in so well into my receptors for my life partner.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a wise builder, our first date did not happen immediately until
          after four months she took up the "supervisory role". We had
          intelligent conversations. From this first hangout, I knew that I had
          reached a peak plasma concentration and I was most likely going to
          marry her. She was so detailed, expressive, courteous and highly
          cerebral. Her deep-thinking ability, genteel communication and
          intelligence were my key takeaways. I saw what she communicated and
          beyond what she communicated as her purpose and passion- the fire in
          her eyes, the hunger for excellence and success in her soul, her
          pizzazz, her brio and oomph… all simply amazing! Oh my, I am in love.
        </p>

        <p>
          From that point going forward, I considered trusting the matter into
          God’s hands, the One who is omnipotent, all-wise and all-knowing. With
          prayers, guidance and confirmations from our spiritual parents,
          earthly parents, mentors and guardians, we are here today and we are
          eager to begin our journey forever.
